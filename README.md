# Computer-Vision

Here I uploaded a project which was my final project in Computer Vision course.

In this project we trained a model to recognize faces using siamese networks, we defined triplet loss and tried to minimize the distance between the posetive image and baseline, and maximize the distance between negative image and baseline.

Extra explanation can be found in the code.
